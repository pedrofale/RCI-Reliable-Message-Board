To run the server ID: `./sid -debug`
To run `msgserv` and `rmb`, you need to make sure you're connecting to the right ID server. If you're running it on your machine, make sure you run `msgserv` and `rmb` with the option `-i` set to your machine's IP address. In linux you can find this out by using the command `ifconfig`.
